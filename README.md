# A Coaching Classes Management Website
Coaching Classes Management System will enable the students, tutors and the staff to maintain and update the records regarding different aspects like fee records, salaries, books, staff, personal information, class assessments and results, notifications and other basic data efficiently without worrying unlike conventional methods of book-keeping.

<p>
Practically it becomes extremely difficult to maintain data when the size inevitably increases. It becomes tedious to write the records using conventional methodology. Even accessibility constraints arise when it comes to portability. Online management would allow access to the data for all types of users from anywhere as well as on any device.
</p>

<p>
The website has a dedicated <b>Admin Dashboard</b> that enables the admin control and access the data on his fingertips. Different sections are maintained for admin.

This project was undertaken for college project submission and thus is in very raw phase. 
Although if time permits, we'll think for further development. 
Lot to complaint about my **first repo** but made me happy tho :)
